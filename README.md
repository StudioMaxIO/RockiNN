# RockiNN
Train and generatie music with a RNN (recurrent neural network)
- GUI for rapidly adjusting hyperparameters
- Easily add music in XYZ notation to training set
- Generate songs from the training set

RockNN is a project I'm building for fun as a way to explore and understand RNNs. Feel free to contribute if this is something that interests you as well. It's not much now, but maybe in time it can be.
