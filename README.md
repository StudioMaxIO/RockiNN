# ðŸŽµ RockiNN ðŸŽ¸

RockiNN is a project I'm building to explore and better understand RNNs. This is an early work in progress. Feel free to contribute if this is something that interests you as well.

## Train and generatie music with a RNN (recurrent neural network)

- GUI for rapidly adjusting hyperparameters
- Easily add music in XYZ notation to training set
- Generate songs from the training set

## Todo:

- [ ] Connect frontend to backend
- [ ] Convert audio / MIDI files to ABC notation for training
- [ ] Record live instrument / vocals and convert to ABC notation
